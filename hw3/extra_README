I've uploaded a text file extra_map_hcrs.txt containing mappings
between Highly Conserved Regions (aka "HCR", or ECE) and exons (or
nearest exons).

Each line lists an hcr and exon.  In the case hcrs that are intronic
or intergenic, the exons listed are the nearest ones (with the
distance and relationship (either "intronic" or "intergenic" noted).
For hcrs that overlap exons, they are noted as "exonic" and no
distance is given.

I've also uploaded the code used to compute these mappings.  Although
each file starts with "extra_", the classes are not prefixed as such,
so to compile the code the file names would have have to be renamed.
Also, there are input files needed that I haven't uploaded.  If you'd
like to compile and run the code, I can provide these files.
