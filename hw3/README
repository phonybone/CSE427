# How to run my program:

# Unpack the vcassen.hw3.tgz to a working directory and unpack it.  It will expand to a directory named vcassen.hw3.
tar xfz vcassen.hw3.tgz

cd vcassen.hw3

# run the convenience script.  It will call ant to compile the source and then run it.  The output will be written to assignment.txt
sh run.sh     

# Note: the histograms in charts.txt will be untouched by run.sh
