To compile and run the programs provided, you'll need java and the
java compilation/building tool, ant. 

Un-tar the HW2.tgz file (it will create it's own directory:
> tar xfz HW2.tgz

Compile the java code:
> ant build

Use a shell script to run the java program three times, once my
organism and twice on the community organism:

> sh run.sh

(Redirect and/or time the output as desired.  On my laptop this takes
about 1 minute to run).
